Are you looking to pick up any work? If you have time, I could use a Netlify-friendly(Gatsby/React) version of only this page: https://property.spatialest.com/nc/durham/#/property/192043/building/6457/changerequest
Only the widget in the center, and no back-end.

I'm thinking we can just get the building info from GET params and parse them using client-side JS?
The form should be able to post all the data in a request body to a Lambda/Cloud-Function, but I can handle the exact FaaS later.

I can throw you $150 for the page.

Interested? If yes, shoot me an email. If you want to do it in UpWork, let me know.
